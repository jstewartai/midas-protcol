abstract: >
  MIDAS is a minimal, falsifiable protocol for measuring and controlling
  semantic drift in multi-turn large language model interactions.
  It defines interaction invariants, operational drift and preservation
  metrics, and a dual-LLM evaluation harness to support independent
  replication and stress testing.
